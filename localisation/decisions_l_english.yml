So we have made the hard choice to employ the use of Mustard Gas on Insurgent targets only. We should also keep note as to how much gas is stockpiled. Should we keep too much in storage, the chance of a gas leak is far more likely and the chance of our attacks succeeding will also decrease.\n\ Stockpiled Gas: §Y[?gas]§! \n\ Current power of the Kurdish People's Party: §R[?kurd_power]%"
